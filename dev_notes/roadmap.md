# Roadmap — outstanding work

What's still open. For history of what shipped, see
[`history.md`](history.md). For the design rationale that drove
the original Phase 1–6 plan, look at the git log around
`8f18e68`–`5d0e23e` (2026-05-09 to 2026-05-10).

The four-step feature pass triggered by the 2026-05-12 Soapbox A1
re-test (Tier 1 hs_groups, briefing-pack modularisation,
`gacc_bilateral_aggregate_yoy`, `partner_share` + extra-EU
aggregates) has shipped — see
[`history.md` § 2026-05-12](history.md#2026-05-12--soapbox-a1-re-test--four-step-feature-pass).

The 2026-05-12/13 polish arc (Phase 6.11 per-reporter breakdown,
orphan hs_group cleanup, first-export audit fixes, documentation
pass, leads.md polish, Top-5 movers digest, trajectory-volatile
suppression, templates pipeline) has also shipped — see
[`history.md` § 2026-05-12/13](history.md#2026-05-1213--polish-for-first-journalist-handover).

## Near-term (likely next session)

### Watch the first 2-3 real cycles + decide delivery vector

Periodic-run **pipeline + Routine** shipped 2026-05-11 (Phase 6.9 /
6.10 — see `history.md` and
[`periodic-runs-design-2026-05-11.md`](periodic-runs-design-2026-05-11.md)).
Routine fires daily at 09:01 local time. What remains is observation
and Layer-3 design:

- **Click "Run now" once from the Scheduled sidebar** to pre-approve
  the tools the Routine uses (`psql`, `python scrape.py ...`).
  Otherwise the first real scheduled run will pause on permission
  prompts.
- **Watch the first 2–3 real cycles land** (whenever the next
  Eurostat release publishes — typically 6-8 weeks after period
  close). Tier 1 currently shows same-day method-bump churn
  (everything created today); after the first real Eurostat-release
  cycle, it'll show the actual data diff. Validate that the diff
  reads usefully editorially.
- **Decide on delivery vector** (Layer 3) once we've seen what a
  real cycle looks like in Lisa's hands. Don't pre-pick
  email / Slack / Drive — pick after the first usable export
  has been delivered manually a few times.
- **Migrate Luke's environment** from laptop to desktop. Steps in
  the design doc § "Migration: laptop → desktop". Routines are
  account-bound; the pipeline is portable via `git clone` +
  `pg_dump | pg_restore`.

## Coverage extension (surfaced by the 2026-05-11 Soapbox validation pass)

Items the Soapbox validation surfaced as real gaps but not on
the periodic-runs critical path. Each is small-to-medium and
self-contained. See
[`soapbox-validation-2026-05-11.md`](soapbox-validation-2026-05-11.md)
for the per-claim test that motivates each.

### Eurostat-side HS-level mirror for "China's exports to EU"

Soapbox routinely quotes GACC-side HS-level figures ("China's
EV+hybrid exports to EU +87% in Q1 2026 at $20.6B"). GACC
sections 5/6 in our DB have only ~30 hand-curated commodity
names (no HS codes), so the GACC-side HS-level test is blocked
on parser work for sections 5 and 6 specifically. The cleaner
path is to rely on Eurostat for HS-level and accept the CIF/FOB
caveat — but the editorial register ("China reported $20.6B...")
isn't substitutable.

### 2017 pre-v2 COMEXT format duplicate `000TOTAL` rows

Surfaced by the §5.4 snapshot refresh on 2026-05-11. The pre-v2
bulk-file format produces duplicate `000TOTAL` rows per
(reporter, period, partner, flow, stat_procedure) — 2017 sp=1
has 648 rows vs 2018 sp=1 has 351. Analyser output is unaffected
(HS LIKE filters skip aggregate rows) but any 2017 raw-row
aggregate rollup is 2x inflated. Forward work to dedupe or
re-ingest 2017 with the v2 parser. Independent of the 000TOTAL
filter rule resolution from 2026-05-10.

## Methodology depth (pick up if a story warrants it)

### Editorial calibration of `low_base_threshold_eur` via shock-validation backtest

Phase 6.3 sensitivity sweep showed €50M is the single largest
editorial-framing driver — 49% of `hs_group_yoy*` findings would
flip low_base classification across €5M–€500M. The default has
never been calibrated against editorial reality. Approach:

1. Take each shock from `shock-validation-2026-05-09.md` (2018
   Section 232 steel, Q1 2020 COVID lockdown, Feb 2022 Russia
   invasion, Oct 2023 EV probe).
2. For each, identify which HS groups carried the story and what
   their absolute 12mo €-figures were at the surfacing anchor.
3. Replay the sensitivity sweep — would those groups have been
   suppressed under €100M? Surfaced cleanly under €25M?
4. Pick the threshold that minimises both false-positive
   (low_base flag on a real story) and false-negative (no flag
   on a story that genuinely rests on a niche base).

Same exercise plausibly applies to the Soapbox-validation
2026-05-11 doc's per-claim concur table. Decide whether to keep
€50M (the engineered floor), shift it, or move to a per-group
threshold seeded from the group's typical EU-27 12mo magnitude.
Discussed 2026-05-12 with the first-export audit.

### CN8 concordance table (Phase 4 carry-over)

Full mapping of old→new codes across Eurostat's annual revisions.
Currently we apply a blanket `cn8_revision` caveat to any YoY
window spanning a year boundary; a real concordance would let us
strip the caveat where the relevant codes didn't change. The
historical Eurostat backfill (2017–2026) spans 9 CN8 revisions so
the blanket caveat is on most findings. Pick up when a story rests
on a precise YoY for a specific HS-CN8 code.

### Per-(country, commodity) CIF/FOB granularity

Phase 4 carry-over partially addressed in
`cif-fob-baselines-2026-05-10.md`. Per-(EU member state, China)
margins are now in `cif_fob_baselines`. The OECD ITIC SDMX endpoint
also supports HS-4 splits (1224 commodities × 28 EU countries × CN
≈ 34k rows) for per-(country, commodity) precision. Schema-extend
`cif_fob_baselines` and pull when a story needs it.

### Structural-break detection (Chow / CUSUM)

Statistically right but unstable on the 11 periods we had at
Phase 1. With the historical Eurostat backfill we now have 110
periods; this is ready to move from parked to scheduled if a
journalist's question warrants it.

### Sector breadth review (round 2)

The 6.5 promote/drop pass shipped 2026-05-10. A year from now a
similar pass should re-evaluate what's editorially live. Three
groups stayed draft (Honey, Polysilicon, Tropical timber) and
might warrant a second look.

## Data sources (deferred until needed)

### 2018 GACC mirror-trade

See [`forward-work-gacc-2018-parser.md`](forward-work-gacc-2018-parser.md).
Title parser handles all 2018 quirks but the section-4 release
pages embed PNG screenshots, not HTML tables. Body parse fails
and the data is in pixels. Options: OCR (~half-day with editorial
risk), hunt for source xlsx, accept gap, lean on Eurostat+HMRC
which already cover 2018.

### Aggregate-label handling for non-EU blocs (ASEAN, RCEP)

Original project requirement. GACC reports trade with these blocs
as labelled aggregates; we don't currently split them into
member-country flows. Pick up if a non-EU-bloc story emerges.

### Chinese-language source URL backfill on `releases`

Most GACC releases have a Chinese-language equivalent at
`www.customs.gov.cn` (vs the English `english.customs.gov.cn`).
The brief constructs the link via `_construct_chinese_source_url`
but we don't store it. Backfill if useful for downstream consumers.

## Future-platform items

### Web UI / hosted deployment

Required for any non-luke-laptop use. AWS-side (Fargate, RDS,
Cognito) per the fuel-finder precedent. Triggers: when a desk
journalist actually wants to use the tool independently.

### Custom Q&A bot (Phase 7+)

See [`forward-work-qa-bot.md`](forward-work-qa-bot.md). Two-tier
scope (ask the findings, ask the underlying data). Tier 1 is ~3-5
days of build. Triggers: web UI exists AND a journalist has a
recurrent question pattern the brief can't answer.

### GoogleSheetsWriter implementation

Pending service-account credentials (was due "next week" as of
2026-05-09). Once available, the sheets-export module wires up
trivially.

## Closed forward-work, kept for reference

These are real options that may be picked up later but aren't on
any near-term path:

- [`shock-validation-2026-05-09.md`](shock-validation-2026-05-09.md)
  + companion `.sql` — pre-registered shock validation
  methodology. Living methodology doc, not just a one-off; re-run
  after any major analyser change. §5.4 refreshed 2026-05-11
  using the canonical `product_nc='000TOTAL'` row.
- [`soapbox-validation-2026-05-11.md`](soapbox-validation-2026-05-11.md)
  — peer-comparison validation against Soapbox Trade
  (substack). 50 testable claims pre-registered, ~60% clean concur,
  ~80% directional. The 2026-05-12 A1 re-test (Stage B/C) drove
  the four-step feature pass (Tier 1 hs_groups, briefing-pack
  modularisation, bilateral aggregate analyser, partner_share +
  extra-EU aggregates) recorded in
  [`history.md`](history.md#2026-05-12--soapbox-a1-re-test--four-step-feature-pass).
  Living methodology doc — re-run after any major analyser change.
